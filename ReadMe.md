### About this project:
Epidemiologist investigating foodborne disease outbreaks often use 
characterstics of the outbreak to narrow down the food source. For example, 
outbreaks with a higher percentage of women are more likely to be from salad 
than beef. Outbreaks with a small geographic reach are more likely to be dairy, 
etc. Epidemiologists incorporate experience and knowldege to help guide their 
search. This project seeks to help formalize some of that guidance by developing
a predictive model. This project uses data obtained from the [CDC's National
Outbreak Reporting System (NORS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nors/about.html). 
The data provided were extracted using the following methodology:  
- mode of transmission = animal contact, environmental, food, person-to-person, 
unknown 
- outbreak report has been finalized  
- onset year between 1998 and 2016  
- number of estimated primary illnesses greater than 1  
- At least one confirmed or suspected etiology of STEC or Salmonella

### About this project:
Epidemiologist investigating foodborne disease outbreaks often use 
characteristics of the outbreak to narrow down the food source. For example, 
outbreaks with a higher percentage of women are more likely to be from salad 
than beef. Outbreaks with a small geographic reach are more likely to be dairy, 
etc. Epidemiologists incorporate experience and knowledge to help guide their 
search. This project seeks to help formalize some of that guidance by developing
a predictive model. This project uses data obtained from the [CDC's National
Outbreak Reporting System (NORS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nors/about.html) from 
1998 to 2016. This app should only be used as a tool to guide outbreak 
investigations and should not be considered definitive on it's own. 
In addition, only prediction of the most common sources is possible.
